# API Security Checklist

Ensure your API follows best security practices by using this checklist.

## API Security Measures

- [ ] **HTTPS (SSL/TLS Encryption)**: Ensure all API traffic is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- [ ] **OAuth 2.0**: Use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, providing secure access without exposing user credentials.
- [ ] **WebAuthn (Web Authentication)**: Implement WebAuthn for strong, passwordless authentication for web applications.
- [ ] **Leveled API Keys**: Use API keys with different access levels (e.g., read-only, admin) to ensure proper access control.
- [ ] **Authorization (Role-Based Access Control)**: Implement fine-grained access controls to ensure users or services have only the necessary permissions.
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Implement versioning to allow safe deprecation of old APIs and maintain backward compatibility.
- [ ] **IP Allowlisting/Whitelisting**: Limit access to the API to specific IP addresses or ranges to reduce exposure to unwanted traffic.
- [ ] **OWASP API Security**: Regularly check and adhere to OWASP API Security best practices to mitigate top API threats (e.g., injection, broken authentication).
- [ ] **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway for traffic management, rate limiting, and security enforcement to protect APIs from common threats.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive details in error messages. Provide generic error responses that do not reveal internal mechanisms.
- [ ] **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure all inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Require strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, JWTs) to ensure only authorized users access the API.
- [ ] **Authorization**: Implement role-based access controls to ensure users have the correct permissions for each resource.
- [ ] **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs to prevent the introduction of executable code and mitigate risks like XSS attacks.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging of all API interactions, including authentication failures and suspicious activities, and monitor these logs regularly for signs of attacks.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Control the number of requests an API client can make to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- [ ] **Token Expiry**: Ensure that tokens (like JWTs) have a short lifespan and require re-authentication to limit exposure from compromised tokens.
- [ ] **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Configure CORS policies to control which domains can access the API.
- [ ] **Data Encryption (At Rest and In Transit)**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using appropriate encryption standards (e.g., AES, TLS).
- [ ] **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: Use anti-CSRF tokens to ensure that requests are legitimate and not from forged sources.
- [ ] **API Throttling**: Implement throttling to prevent API abuse and protect against large-scale attacks like brute-force attempts.
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Use security headers such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Content-Security-Policy to mitigate attacks.
- [ ] **Traffic Filtering (DDoS Protection)**: Use firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and API gateways to filter traffic and block malicious requests.
- [ ] **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**: Use HMAC for verifying message integrity and ensuring data authenticity.
- [ ] **Session Management**: Implement secure session management techniques, including session timeouts and revocation.
- [ ] **Egress Filtering**: Control outbound API traffic to prevent data leakage or communication with unauthorized third parties.
- [ ] **Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in the API.
- [ ] **API Documentation Security**: Secure API documentation portals with authentication and restrict access to sensitive internal documentation.
